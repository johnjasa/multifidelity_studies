class BaseMethod:
    """
    The base class that all multifidelity optimization methods inherit from.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model_low : BaseModel instance
        The low-fidelity model instance provided by the user.
    model_high : BaseModel instance
        The high-fidelity model instance provided by the user.
    bounds : array
        A 2D array of design variable bounds, e.g. [[0., 1.], ...] for
        each design variable.
    disp : bool, optional
        If True, the method will print out progress and results to the terminal.
    counter_plot : int
        Int for the number of plots that have been created so the filenames
        are saved correctly.
    objective : string
        Name of the objective function whose output is provided by the user-provided
        models.
    objective_scaler : float
        Multiplicative scaling factor applied to the objective function before
        passing it to the optimizer. Useful for mamximizing functions instead
        of minimizing them by providing a negative number.
    constraints : list of dicts
        Each dict contains the constraint output name, the constraint type (equality
        or inequality), and the constraint value. One dict for each set of constraints.
    n_dims : int
        Number of dimensions in the design space, i.e. number of design variables.
    x : array
        2-D array containing all of the queried design points. Rows (the 2nd dimension)
        contain the design vectors, whereas the number of columns (the 1st dimension)
        correspond to the number of design points.
    approximation_functions : dict of callables
        Dictionary whose keys are the string names of all functions of interest
        (objective and all constraints) and the corresponding values are callable
        funcs for an approximation of those values across the design space.

        num_initial_points : int
            The number of initial points to use to populate the surrogate-based
            approximations of the methods. In general, higher dimensional problems
            require more initial points to get a reasonable surrogate approximation.

        """
        Create callable functions for each of the corrected low-fidelity
        models by constructing surrogate models for the error between
        low- and high-fidelity results.
        
        Follows the process laid out by multiple trust-region methods presented
        in the literature where we construct a corrected low-fidelity model.
        This correction comes from a surrogate model trained by the error between
        the low- and high-fidelity models. Each call to one of these callable
        funcs runs the low-fidelity model and queries the surrogate model at
        that design point to obtain the corrected output.
        
        This method create approximation functions for the objective function and
        all constraints in the same way.
        
        Depending on the smoothness of the underlying functions, certain surrogate
        models may be better suited to model the error between the models.
        Future studies could focus on when to use which surrogate model.
